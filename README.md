# kecleon

My own personal design system / front-end toolkit that I utilize for my
software projects.

## Installing

If you wish to use kecleon in your project, all you need to do
is add it as a dependency, such as below:

```sh
yarn add @tiernebre/kecleon

# or if you use NPM

npm install @tiernebre/kecleon
```

## Developing

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- Yarn

#### Steps

1. Install dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

2. Start up a local Storybook server that lets you develop the components without
   needing to link to another project:

```sh
yarn start
```
